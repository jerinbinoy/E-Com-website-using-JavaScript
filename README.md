# E-Com-website-using-JavaScript
An E Com website only using JavaScript , Bootstrap ,CSS and HTML

This is simple e-com website developed for learning HTML ,JavaScript ,CSS and Bootstrap. As a beginner i am much satisfied with this project but there are lot of bugs and problems. Those who are interested
to help me in solving the problems and developing this project more attractive are welcomed. This is the first project in the frontend development. And this website is not fully functional. Because we all know
that an e-commerce website wont become fully functional without backend. So i beleive that i made something that is at its maximum potential. This is just a beginning and there are lot to come after this.
